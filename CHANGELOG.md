# Changelog

## 17.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 8f60fbf: Enable async tranformers in test utils.
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [17.1.1] 2024-10-31

### Fixed

- Republished with `temp` dependency properly removed (#638, thanks @trivikr for reporting)

## [17.1.0] 2024-10-30

### Added

- `pkg.pr.new` will now be used to build an npm pakage for each commit to the repo, allowing you to more easily test changes or use new features before an official release is cut. (#622, @Aslemammad)

### Changed

- Replaced `temp` library with `tmp` (#633, @r4zendev)

### Fixed

- Removed old `docs` command from `package.json` since the new docs are in the `website` folder, which has instructions in its README.

## [17.0.0] 2024-08-06

We needed to go [from v0.x to a major release](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/issues/593), and it may as well happen now. jscodeshift has been around for nine years though, so going to v1.0.0 didn't feel quite right. I've instead promoted the minor version number to a major version number, similar to what React did when it went from 0.14 to 15.0.

### Fixed

- Node.js 16 is now explicitly specified as the minimum required version. It was _already_ implicitly required due to some dependencies requiring it, but this wasn't explicitly specified until now. (#607, @trivikr)

### Added

- A new [jscodeshift website](https://jscodeshift.com/) has launched, thanks to the team at [Codemod](https://codemod.com/). (#592, @mohab-sameh with some tweaks by @morinokami)
- Added collection functions for import declarations, including finding imports and inserting new imports (#617, @danieldelcore)

### Changed

- Enabled TypeScript `importAttributes` (#585, @benasher44) and `decoratorAutoAccessors` (#594, @syi0808) plugins
- Removed or replaced various outdated and unused dependencies (#601, #605, #609, #613, @trivikr)
- Started using Corepack to manage Yarn version (#599, @trivikr)

### Fixed

## [0.13.1] 2022-01-10

- Better handling of `.gitingore` files: Ignore comments and support `\r\n` line breaks ([PR #306](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/pull/306))

## [0.6.3] 2019-01-18

### Fixed

- Don't throw an error when jscodeshift processes an empty set of files (#295,
  @skovhus).
- `renameTo` should not rename class properties (#296, @henryqdineen).
- Custom/unknown CLI parameters are parsed as JSON, just like nomnom used to
  do.

## [0.6.2] 2018-12-05

### Changed

- `@babel/register`/`@babel/preset-env` is configured to not transpile any
  language features that the running Node process supports. That means if you use
  features in your transform code supported by the Node version you are running,
  they will be left as is. Most of ES2015 is actually supported since Node v6.
- Do not transpile object rest/spread in transform code if supported by running
  Node version.

### Fixed

- Presets and plugins passed to `@babel/register` are now properly named and
  loaded.

## [0.6.1] 2018-12-04

### Added

- Tranform files can be written in Typescript. If the file extension of the
  transform file is `.ts` or `.tsx`, `@babel/preset-typescript` is used to
  convert them. This requires the `--babel` option to be set (which it is by
  default). ( #287 , @brieb )

### Changed

- The preset and plugins for converting the transform file itself via babeljs
  have been updated to work with babel v7. This included removing
  `babel-preset-es2015` and `babel-preset-stage-1` in favor of
  `@babel/preset-env`. Only `@babel/proposal-class-properties` and
  `@babel/proposal-object-rest-spread` are enabled as experimental features. If
  you want to use other's in your transform file, please create a PR.

### Fixed

- Typescript parses use `@babel/parser` instead of Babylon ( #291, @elliottsj )

### Bumped

- `micromatch` => v3.1.10, which doesn't (indirectly) depend on `randomatic` <
  v3 anymore (see #292).
