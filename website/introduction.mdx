title: Overview

`jscodeshift` is a toolkit for building and running codemods over multiple JavaScript or TypeScript files. It provides:

- A runner, which executes the provided transform for each file passed to it. It also outputs a summary of how many files have **not** been transformed.
- A wrapper around [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast), providing a different API.  Recast is an AST-to-AST transform tool and also tries to preserve the style of original code
as much as possible.

## Installation

Get jscodeshift from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscodeshift):

```
$ npm install -g jscodeshift
```

This will install the runner as `jscodeshift`.
